Hi viewer! I'm Alex and this is my second project "Readable" on udacity. It involved skills in react and redux.

To launch it you need to install react on your computer and then :

1) cd into the directory containing the files

2) a series of npm install :
- npm install bootstrap --save
- npm install form-serialize
- npm install react-modal
- npm install react-redux
- npm install react-router-dom
- npm install reactstrap
- npm install redux
- npm install redux-thunk


3) npm start
